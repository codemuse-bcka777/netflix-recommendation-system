# 🎬 Netflix Show Recommendation System

This is a content-based recommendation system built using Python and Google Colab. It recommends similar Netflix shows based on selected inputs using cosine similarity on show descriptions and genres.

## 🔍 Features
- Uses TF-IDF Vectorization on metadata
- Applies Cosine Similarity to find similar shows
- Built using clean Python code in Google Colab
- Lightweight, beginner-friendly codebase

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📂 Files
- `netflix_recommender.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Add evaluation metrics like precision@k
- Build a Streamlit app for user interaction
- Expand dataset beyond Netflix
- Use NLP for deeper semantic analysis

## 6. Future Work & Improvements
- 🔄 **Switch to hybrid recommendations**: Combine content-based with collaborative filtering for more personalized results.
- 🗣️ **Use NLP models (BERT, SBERT)**: Improve show similarity with semantic sentence embeddings instead of TF-IDF.
- 📈 **Add quantitative metrics**: Use more advanced evaluations like NDCG, MAP, or Precision@k (on labeled data).
- 🌐 **Build a web app**: Use Streamlit to turn the notebook into a user-friendly, clickable recommender.
- 📦 **Expand dataset**: Include ratings, user behavior, or tags to enrich recommendations.
- 🧠 **Integrate AI/ML models**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression or neural network) for dynamic ranking.
- 🎓 **Deploy to the web**: Host on Hugging Face Spaces, Render, or Streamlit Cloud with GitHub integration.
